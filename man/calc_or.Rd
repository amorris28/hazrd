\title{Calculate a odds ratio between two percentile groups (low-level)}
\usage{
calc_or(df, or_age, numerator, denominator)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{a data.frame containing the columns phs, age, and status}

\item{or_age}{an integer specifying the age at which the odds ratio should be calculated}

\item{numerator}{a vector specifying the quantiles of the upper interval. If a single value is given, that will be used as the lower quantile and the upper quantile will be \code{Inf}. If a vector of length 2 is provided then these will be used as the lower and upper quantiles of the interval (e.g., \code{c(0.80, 0.98)}).}

\item{denominator}{a vector specifying the quantiles of the lower interval. If a single value is given, that will be used as the upper quantile and the lower quantile will be \code{-Inf}. If a vector of length 2 is provided then these will be used as the lower and upper quantiles of the interval (e.g., \code{c(0.30, 0.70)}).}
}
\value{
A numeric odds ratio

This function performs the actual OR calculation used internally by
\code{\link{get_or}}. Most users should call \code{get_or()} directly.
This function is exported to provide transparency and reproducibility.
